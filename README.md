ECOGEN
======

**ECOGEN** is a CFD plateform written in C++ object oriented programming langage. It is dedicated to numerical simulation of compressible multiphase flows. It has the vocation to share academics researches in the multiphase flow field in direction to ohter academics but also for industrials, students, etc.

What can I do with ?
--------------------
With **ECOGEN** you can solve:

* Interface problems between pure or multicomponents fluids and mixtures of multiphase flows.
* Flow problems involving surface tension, heat and mass transfers for evaporating and condensing flow, cavitation.
* Wave propagation problems in strongly unsteady situations using a specific Adaptative Mesh Reffinement.
* complex flow problems on unstructured grids.

Start with ECOGEN
-----------------
The better way to start with **ECOGEN** is to follow installation instructions on the official documentation webSite: https://code-mphi.github.io/ECOGEN/docs/sphinx_docs/Chap2_installation_Chapter.html

Then you can follow the dedicated tutorial to run your first test: https://code-mphi.github.io/ECOGEN/docs/sphinx_docs/Chap4_1startWithECOGEN.html

Dependencies
------------
ECOGEN requires a C++ compiler and an MPI implementation providing the ``mpicxx``
command. On Ubuntu the following packages install the required tools:

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential libopenmpi-dev openmpi-bin
```
Running on HPC clusters
-----------------------
A Slurm submission script (scripts/ecogen.slurm) is provided to run ECOGEN on clusters. Adjust module commands and resources then submit with:
sbatch scripts/ecogen.slurm
